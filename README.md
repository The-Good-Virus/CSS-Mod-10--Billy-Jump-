# This Game is Completed

# This repository is the presentation of my game and a final assignment for my CSS class
# You play as Billy Jump who is a rocky mountain goat. Billy has to jump his way back home on the unforgiving Rocky Mountains. If time runs out Billy will be caught in the incoming blizzard. Be careful though, Billy could run into many obstacles whether it is terrain difficulties or lack of endurance.
# Type in the following numbers so you can guide Billy to safety! 

# Controls:
# Press "Enter" to play the game or press "q" if you don't want to play
# 1 Ask For Directions
# 2 Find Food
# 3 Jump
# 4 Rest

# The two improvements that I want to make to Billy Jump are the overall story so it does not sound as repetitive for each chapter and the number of choices Billy could have that make the game more merciful or complicated. That or include a pause button so the player has time to think without risking losing more time in their run.
