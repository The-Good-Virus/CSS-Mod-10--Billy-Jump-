# CSS-Mod-10-Billy-Jump-
This repository is the presentation of my game and a final assignment for my CSS class
You play as Billy Jump who is a rocky mountain goat. Billy has to jump his way back home on the unforgiving Rocky Mountains. If time runs out Billy will be caught in the incoming blizzard. Be careful though, Billy could run into many obstacles whether it is terrain difficulties or lack of endurance.
Type in the following numbers so you can guide Billy to safety!
